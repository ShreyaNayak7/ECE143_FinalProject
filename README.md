Please note that both this "README" file and the corresponding repository may not be complete until the deadline for our final project for the "ECE 143" course of Spring 2019.

# README

## Descriptions of The Python Code in this Repository:

1. **plots_for_Government_Expenditure_on_Education.py**

**plots_for_Government_Expenditure_on_Education.py** should eventually have a lot of functions for plotting the data in Reference 1 that is related to Government Expenditure on Education.

2. **gather_data.py**

**gather_data.py** should be made to have functions that can be used to store data in accessible formats for plotting purposes.

## Current and/or Recommended Direcories:

* Downloaded Data

    * This directory should have raw data that is downloaded. Citations for this data should eventually be included in this file.

* Saved_Data
    * This directory can include NumPy arrays and other forms of data that can be directly used in a Python program.

Please note that the following section may not be complete yet.
