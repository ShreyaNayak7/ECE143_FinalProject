# README

## Descriptions of Submitted Python Code:

1. **first_plots.py**

This file will eventually have code that includes functions for making our first plots.

2. **gather_data.py**

This file should be made to have functions that can be used to store data in accessible formats for plotting purposes.

## Current and/or Recommended Direcories:

* Downloaded Data

    * This directory should have raw data that is downloaded. Citations for this data should eventually be included in this file.

* Saved_Data
    * This directory can include NumPy arrays and other forms of data that can be directly used in a Python program.

## Future Citations for Future Downloaded Data in the Future "Downloaded_Data" Directory:
